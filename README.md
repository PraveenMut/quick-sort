# Quicksort Algorithm written in Python

# Summary
Built a standard quicksort algorithm entirely from scratch.
- Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log(n))
- Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Average Space Complexity: O(n)

# Methodology
Employed 2 procedures to streamline and simplify the entire program itself. Instead of creating the partition within the parent quicksort procedure, the partition procedure was built before the parent quicksort counterpart.

This uses the standard checking the partition to move the elements of an indexable array.
